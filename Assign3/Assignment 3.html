<h3> Campaign Idea </h3>
	<p>This product is called Project: Roommate. It’s a monthly subscription box that contains a craft 
	with enough supplies for 4 final products, coupons for a night in and a night out, an optional 
	disposable camera and snacks. My campaign is based on my own experience with roommates 
	that I wish I could do more things with.  This is targeted towards female college students with 
	roommates, it’s an easy way to put aside a day to do things with your friends, once a month. 
	The idea is to appeal to the students who are sad and stressed from studying and this can give 
	them one day to look forward to admits all the assignments and papers. I decided a craft would 
	be better than a box that just shipped them a box full of things for a night in because it could 
	help decorate their home as well. I chose to do a youtuber style campaign because I thought if I 
	appealed to backers on a personal level, I would get more money for the product and they 
	would feel connected to its creator and the product.    </p>
<h3> Video Editing</h3>
	<p>For this project, I used the video editing software Lightworks. Initially, I filmed a long video with my mistakes because I knew I could edit it out, I also filmed a few close-up shots of the product.  I placed the video in the editor and started to use the “delete the marked section” to edit out my mistakes. Once I got the clips that I wanted I imported the close-up clip of the product and then I dragged and dropped it into the video track and played the audio and placed a marker where I wanted the closeup clip to start. I also added the Luma Wipe and Sharpen effects to the close-up clip. Music was also added lower than my voice. For the intro and conclusion, I changed the volume so it was louder during the intro and outro and lower while I was talking. I also added text, through the text effects, that lists off rewards for my backers with a typewriter effect. Near the end, I edited in my product logo over the video with the negative, lumakey, image and Luma source effect. For the credits, I used a clip of the product with the glow effect and rolling text for credit. After, I used the marker to select all I had done and move it forward on the track so I had enough room to place two more clips for my intro. Throughout the intro I have text in various fonts, some of it slides horizontally through, some fading in and out, I have some with the typewriter effect and more with the rolling effect. Lastly, I used a different program to edit a transparent photo of myself and used the image and blend effects to add it to the video. </p>
